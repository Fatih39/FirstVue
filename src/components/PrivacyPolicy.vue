Each party therefore agrees that the other party shall be entitled, in addition to other available remedies, to seek and be awarded an injunction or other appropriate equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction restraining any breach, threatened or actual, of this Agreement. Each party waives any requirement that the other party post any bond or other security in the event any injunctive or equitable relief is sought by or awarded to enforce any provision of this Agreement.

KiteSense may amend, revise or update these Master Terms and Conditions at any time. Such amendment, revision or update shall be effective upon 30 days’ notice to Customer by any means reasonable to give Customer actual or constructive notice, including by posting such terms on KiteSense’s website. In the event Customer does not agree with any amendment, revision or update, Customer shall give KiteSense notice within 30 days of receiving actual or constructive notice from KiteSense and Customer and KiteSense shall negotiate in good faith to come to an agreement solely with respect to such amendment, revision or update. In the event Customer does not give notice to KiteSense, Customer’s continued use of the Service after the 30-day notice period shall indicate Customer’s agreement with any such amendment, revision or update. The Parties agree that: (a) this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter thereof, and any prior representations, statements, and agreements relating thereto are superseded by the terms of this Agreement; and (b) Customer may use purchase orders or similar documents only as proof of acceptance of each Order Form and for convenience only, and all terms and conditions (preprinted or otherwise and regardless of how referenced) shall be void and of no effect.

This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their successors and permitted assigns. Any failure by either party to enforce the other party's strict performance of any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of its right to subsequently enforce such provision or any other provision of this Agreement.
